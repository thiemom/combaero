# Junction model validation

Consolidated dataset + scoring runner for steady-flow T-junction loss
coefficients. Used to compare candidate junction models against measured
data from the canonical references, with the published analytical
correlation as a "best-1D-physics-can-do" ceiling.

## Excluded sources

The directory `docs/junction/` includes several PDFs not used in this
dataset:
- **Stigler 2010**: theoretical paper, no measurements; paper itself states
  measurements "are going to be done soon" (i.e., never within the paper).
- **Torregrosa 2017**: unsteady wave propagation (transmission /
  reflection coefficients), not steady K. Could be a separate
  acoustic-tier dataset later if needed.

## Convergence is measured somewhere else

The scorecard's convergence column is measured on cases whose boundary
conditions are built from Bassett's analytical K at a target split. That is
right for accuracy and circular for robustness: it asks how often the solver
reaches an operating point the paper's own correlation predicts, on the same
points the closure has been measured against.

`random_robustness.py` asks the production question instead. It draws geometry
and boundary conditions uniformly inside physical ranges, with no reference to
any paper, and reports whether the solver returns an admissible answer:

    uv run python -m validation.junction.random_robustness 2000

The width of the sample space is the point -- a narrow space could be
flattered by tuning. `python/tests/test_junction_random_robustness.py` pins the
ranges so narrowing them shows up in a diff, and keeps the convergence floor
loose so it catches regressions rather than inviting anyone to optimise
against it.

It separates draws with **no root** from solver failures. A third of random
draws constrain a function of the split to a value the closure cannot produce;
counting those as failures is a category error.

## How candidate models are scored

For each `ValidationCase` (one row of a measured CSV):
- Evaluate the candidate model at the case's (q, psi, theta, M).
- Evaluate the paper's own analytical correlation (the "ceiling").
- Compute `MAPE_meas` (vs measured truth) and `MAPE_ceil` (vs the ceiling
  correlation). Headline metric: `Delta_vs_ceiling = MAPE_meas - MAPE_ceil`.
  Negative = candidate beats published 1D physics.

The scorecard reports per (model, K, regime, psi-bin, theta-bin):
- `N`, `RMSE_meas`, `MAE_meas`, `bias_meas`, `pct_within_uncertainty`,
  `Delta_vs_ceiling`.
- For network-mode evaluation: `pct_converged`, `median_wall_time_ms`,
  `median_residual_norm`.

A candidate model can have an `excellent` score on K2/K5/K6/K12 (the
well-fit Ks) and a `poor` score on K9/K10 and still be correct — because
the underlying 1D physics itself struggles in type 5. The fit-tier ratings
in `data/bassett2001/README.md` capture this.
