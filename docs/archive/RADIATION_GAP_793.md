# Radiation gap: what a minimal, sourced combaero radiation capability needs

Design record, 2026-11-02, from screening the radiation collection (validation/sources.yaml, topic radiation). It covers #793, the liner-wall-temperature examples: Lefebvre & Ballal Ch. 8, Topal 2014, the Pretoria T56 work and F101. Today combaero has no radiation at all. `components.py` says "Radiation is not modelled".

## 1. Pieces

A liner wall balance is R1 + C1 = R2 + C2 = K1-2 (Lefebvre Eq. 8.25). combaero already has C1, C2 and K (convection, ThermalWall/WallLayer). Four pieces are missing.

| Piece | Minimal closure | Held source | Validity / caveat |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gas-to-liner radiation R1 | R1 = 0.5 sigma (1 + eps_w) eps_g Tg^1.5 (Tg^2.5 - Tw^2.5) (Eq. 8.7), from Eq. 8.5 with alpha_g/eps_g = (Tg/Tw)^1.5 (Eq. 8.6) | Lefebvre & Ballal 3rd ed. Ch. 8 (held); Andreini 2007 and Topal 2014 reprint it | Primaries: Lefebvre & Herbert 1960 (wanted). eps_w is about 0.7 for Nimonic and 0.8 for stainless steel (book). This is a gray, single-zone, well-mixed estimate. Tg is the mean "effective" gas temperature (Eq. 8.8). |
| Non-luminous eps_g | (A) Reeves: eps_g = 1 - exp[-290 P L (q l_b)^0.5 Tg^-1.5], with P in kPa, q the fuel/air mass ratio and L = 1 (Eqs. 8.9/8.11). (B) Composition-based WSGG: Bordbar 2014 (1 atm) or Bordbar 2021 (0.1-80 atm). | (A) L&B Ch. 8. (B) Bordbar 2014 and 2021 (held, sources/radiation/) | (A) The primary is Reeves 1956, NGTE Memo M285, an industrial gas turbine burning kerosine. The fit range is unknown. It is written in q, so it is implicitly a kerosine-product law and does not carry over to natural gas or H2. (B) 2014: T 500-2400 K, pL 0.01-60 atm m, Mr 0.01-4, 1 atm only. 2021: 300-3000 K, ten discrete pressures, Mr 0.1-4. It needs a p-interpolation choice, and the coefficients are under a NON-COMMERCIAL, no-redistribution licence, so they cannot ship on PyPI without the author's permission. Neither covers Mr -> infinity (H2/NH3 products, Fu et al. 2026). |
| Luminous term | Multiply by the luminosity factor L in Eq. 8.11. L = 336/H^2 (H = fuel H mass %, Eq. 8.15, Lefebvre's engine-data fit) is the default. Alternatives: L = 7.53 (C/H - 5.5)^0.84 (Eq. 8.12, original), 3 (C/H - 5.2)^0.75 (Eq. 8.13), and Kretschmer-Odgers 0.0691 (C/H - 1.82)^2.71 (Eq. 8.14). | L&B Ch. 8 | The data behind L are not held (AFWAL-TR-84-2104, Lefebvre 1984 IJHMT, Kretschmer & Odgers 78-GT-90, all wanted). The four forms disagree, so the shipped form must be named. A soot-volume-fraction route (Liu et al. 2020: kappa_s = 6 pi E(m) f_s / lambda) is out of reach because combaero carries no soot. Geigle 2015 is background only. |
| Mean beam length l_b | l_b = 3.4 V/A (Eq. 8.10, after Fishenden & Saunders 1950). This gives 0.6-0.9 D_L for tubular liners. For annular liners it gives 1.0 D_L (inner) and 1.2 D_L (outer). | L&B Ch. 8; Howell 7th ed. on-line App. B (held) | The textbook value is Le = 0.9 x 4V/A = 3.6 V/A (Howell App. B, Example K.1). The two differ by 6%. Ship 3.4 for fidelity to the #793 examples and document the difference. |
| Liner-to-casing R2 | Gray two-surface enclosure, F = 1: R2 = sigma eps_w eps_c / (eps_c + eps_w (1 - eps_c) A_w/A_c) (Tw2^4 - T3^4) (Eq. 8.17). Book shortcuts are 0.4 sigma (aluminium casing) and 0.6 sigma (steel casing) (Eqs. 8.18/8.19). | L&B Ch. 8 (Eq. 8.16 is the general form) | Standard enclosure physics; the source only matters for the shortcuts. Use the casing temperature, or T3 as the book does. A_w/A_c is 0.8 for tuboannular liners, otherwise the diameter ratio. |

### Implementation shape (for whoever opens the issue)

The project rules shape the implementation:

- **C++ kernels with (f, J).** R1 is the value; its derivative is dR1/dTw = -1.25 sigma (1 + eps_w) eps_g Tg^1.5 Tw^1.5. Tg enters through eps_g.
- **Derivatives with respect to Tg.** d eps_g/dTg is analytic for Reeves.
- **The wall's two radiation terms.** R2 is cold-side and R1 hot-side, attached to ThermalWall like the existing convective sides.
- **Inputs.** Pressure, Tg, q (or composition), l_b from the passage geometry, L from the fuel's H mass fraction, and eps_w and eps_c as user inputs with the book's defaults.

## 2. What can falsify it (VALIDATION_POLICY split)

1. **Fidelity: Lefebvre & Ballal Ch. 8 worked examples (held).** These are printed-quantity fidelity checks. The uncooled liner has Tw1/Tw2 = 1640/1603 K, the film-cooled case 1283/1265 K and the TBC case 1304/1236/1220 K. Re-solving the printed chain already reproduces them within 1 K (register entry). The test is that a combaero network with the new R1/R2 kernels gives the same values, using the book's Tg = 2280 K as an input. This exercises Eqs. 8.7, 8.9/8.11, 8.10 and 8.17-8.19 together. It cannot test the physics of eps_g, only our implementation.
2. **Kernel cross-check, accuracy only.** At 1 atm, compare Reeves eps_g with Bordbar 2014 on kerosine products for several q and l_b. Two further one-number checks from Howell (Alberti spreadsheet): Example K.1 (eps_g 0.1451: ethane products, 1853 K, Le 1.44 m) and Example F.1 (0.401, Le 2.4 m). Both models are model-to-model, so any gap is labelled as a model difference, not as error.
3. **Cross-source accuracy against measured radiant flux: Humenik, Claus & Neely (NASA TM-83436 and TM-83538, wanted, public).** The rig is a tubular-can combustor tested at 0.34-2.07 MPa, 533-700 K and F/A 0.008-0.021. Two fuels were run: Jet A (13.9% H) and ERBS (12.9% H). Total and spectral radiometers sit at three stations, and liner temperatures were measured. This is the first case that tests L against fuel H content and pressure on a different rig. Rudey & Graham 1984 (held) show it reduced to radiant flux per station (idle 269 kPa, cruise 700 kPa, take-off 1740 kPa). Usable only if the TMs print the can geometry and zone gas temperatures; unchecked.
4. **F101 (Lefebvre Fig. 8.5), behind AFWAL-TR-84-2104 (wanted).** This is the data Eq. 8.15 was fitted to. It is a fidelity test of L = 336/H^2 on its author's own data, and an accuracy test of the whole chain if the conditions are printed.
5. **Weak cases.** Ballal & Lefebvre SME4 Figs. 5/6: thermal-paint ranges, gas T from an assumed efficiency. Topal 2014: measured paint and thermocouple temperatures, but the geometry, FAR and L are not printed. Treat both as qualitative.

Remove: nothing.

## 4. NASA tubular-can case (screened)

Both TMs were screened from page images on 2026-11-02. Draft entries are in `entries.yaml`. The conclusion is that validation case 3 in section 2 is weaker than hoped.

- **No geometry.** Neither report prints the liner diameter, length, louvers/slots, holes, annulus, air split or pressure drop. The only dimensions are the 25.4 cm housing and the instrument stations: total gauges at x = 12.7, 18.5 and 28.7 cm, spectral ports at 7.4, 22.1 and 34.0 cm. The thermocouple layout implies 10 louvers, undimensioned. The liner carries a TBC on Hastelloy, of unstated thickness. **It cannot be a combaero liner network case.**
- **Conditions are complete.** P3 0.34-2.07 MPa, T3 533/616/700 K, the airflow per point (constant flow parameter, U_ref 15 m/s on the housing) and f/a 0.016 (sweep 0.0087-0.0212) are all printed. So are Jet A (13.9 % H, 17.2 % aromatics) and ERBS (12.9 % H, 28.8 %).
- **Data are plotted only, without uncertainty.** That covers the total radiant flux per zone, the outer-wall (T_liner - T3) per zone, and 12 flame-emissivity points: Fig. 7 of TM-83538, Jet A, 533 K, f/a 0.016. There is no gas temperature, no zone f/a and no l_b.
- **Usable as an accuracy test of L, in ratio form.** ERBS/Jet A flux at equal P3, T3, f/a and nozzle, where the TM says Tg is unchanged between fuels. Measured: +56 % (primary, 0.34 MPa) falling to +5 % (2.0 MPa); none in the tertiary zone. A screening estimate (not a record) with Fig. 7's emissivities gives:

  | L form | Predicted ERBS/Jet A ratio (0.34 / 2.0 MPa) |
  |---|---|
  | L = 336/H^2 | 1.14 / 1.06 |
  | The C/H forms | 1.31-1.50 / 1.13-1.18 |

  The 336/H^2 form under-predicts the low-pressure fuel effect. The C/H forms come closer at low pressure but over-predict at 2 MPa. No form fits both ends. This is the cross-source (same lab, different rig to F101) accuracy evidence for picking the L form; it is not fidelity.
- **Absolute flux or eps_g against P3.** This is possible only with an assumed l_b (liner diameter) and Tg, so it carries assumption labels.
- **The TM's own model.** TM-83538's liner model is NREC 1980 plus a Juhasz-Marek film with C_m 0.05, and alpha_w 0.4 for the TBC. Its non-luminous formula is misprinted, so it is a method check only.
- **Next leads (wanted).** These may hold the geometry:
  - Srivatsa 1982, NASA CR-167930, which predicted this rig (NTRS 19820021901; scripted downloads truncate, fetch in a browser).
  - Claus 1981, NASA TP-1722.
  - NREC 1344-2 (1980).

## 5. Decision the user has to make

Which non-luminous kernel ships?

- **Reeves (Eq. 8.9) alone.** Simplest. It matches the #793 examples, but it is kerosine-only and has no stated range.
- **Reeves plus a composition-based option.** The option would be Bordbar 2014 (shippable? its licence is unchecked; the 2014 paper prints Table 1 in the article) or Alberti (once obtained). Bordbar 2021 cannot ship without the author's permission.

The luminous factor L can only be the Lefebvre family until a soot model exists.
