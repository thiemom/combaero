# CombAero TODO -



---

## Notes

- Do NOT commit this TODO.md file itself
- Each phase must be fully tested before moving to next
- Composite functions are the most valuable but require careful testing
- Machine precision testing is critical for composite functions
- **All composite functions must return dataclasses** (not tuples or individual values)
- Design with future `.to_dict()` serialization in mind
- Property names should be valid Python identifiers and good dict keys
