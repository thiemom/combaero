"""An impingement array with an initial crossflow, against the authors' own
flow data: Florschuetz, Metzger and Su (1982), NASA CR-3630, Table D.1 (#467).

42 tests: 11 inline geometries (xn/d 5, 10; yn/d 4, 8; z/d 1, 2, 3), each at
initial-to-jet flow ratios mc/mj of 0 to about 1, ten rows each. Per row the
table gives P/P0 (channel static over jet plenum), Gj/Gj_mean and Gc/Gj. The
jet flows are the authors' own, inferred from the measured P with a constant
plate Cd (their Eq. 4.1): that is the quantity this network computes, so the
comparison is like for like. Fidelity: the source's own data
(docs/VALIDATION_POLICY.md).

The rig is reproduced as built: jet plenum at the measured P0 and T0; the
total jet flow from Re_j; the initial crossflow a fixed flow delivered along
the gap's upstream end (CR-3630 ran it 16 to 95 hydraulic diameters before
the array, so it arrives with its momentum, which the lead-in carries); the
plate's own mean Cd from Table 3.1; channel width 18.29 cm (18 holes at
yn/d 4, d 0.254 cm).

What the network leaves out, and where it shows: the authors' own analysis
says the discharge coefficient falls with crossflow and wall shear matters
at z/d = 1 with large crossflow, and that no adequate friction model exists
for these flows. Those cases are reported, with a looser bound, not dropped.
