The last structural gap #389 names, and the one no range check can close:
every coordinate is in range, the quantity is simply not the same one.
This project has hit it three times -- Rohde's total-referenced `Cd`
against McGreehan-Schotsch's static, Andrews' `h_m` over the hole length
against his own `h` on the plate area (worth -60%), and a gas-side `h`
quoted without its unblown baseline (worth 1.75x).
