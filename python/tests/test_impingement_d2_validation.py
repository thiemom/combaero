"""An impingement array with an initial crossflow, against the heat transfer
of Florschuetz, Metzger and Su (1982), NASA CR-3630, Table D.2 (#467).

CROSS-SOURCE: accuracy, not fidelity (docs/VALIDATION_POLICY.md). Same lab,
different studies: the bypass reference temperature's eta_r closure is
fitted to CR-3936 Appendix A, the jet h to Florschuetz et al. (1981); neither
saw these points. The extraction record is
validation/cooling/extractions/florschuetz_metzger_su_1982_cr3630_table_d2.md
(signed off 2026-10-24).

The rig is solved as built, at each D.2 test's own Re_j and mc/mj (the
network of test_impingement_bypass_validation.py), with the initial
crossflow 20 K above the jets. Per row the plate reports Nu and T_aw, so

    eta = (T_aw - T_j) / (T_0 - T_j)

is D.2's ETA (Eq. 5.3: referenced to the entrance crossflow temperature).
The jet plenum's P0 and T0 come from the D.1 test of the same geometry and
nearest mc/mj; D.2 prints neither. B(10,4,2) has no D.1 test, so it is
left out rather than run at an invented pressure: 10 inline geometries, 40
tests, 400 in-array rows (300 with an initial crossflow).

Staggered B(5,4,3)S is outside the eta_r closure and is not scored here.
