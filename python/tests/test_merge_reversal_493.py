"""A merge chamber whose main inlet reverses keeps its face (#493).

The chamber hands its declared main inlet the face state of its impulse
balance. That balance holds for either sign of the main flow (the x-momentum
flux through the face is m_main^2 / (rho A) both ways), but the face used to
switch off once the main was no longer an inflow: at m_main -> 0+ the face sits
below the chamber pressure (the side streams carry momentum out), so the main's
exit pressure stepped 245 Pa and its residual 3.5 kPa as its flow crossed zero.
