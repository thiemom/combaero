"""hybr on a Jacobian that is singular but for underflow-level entries (#1027).

The hybrj twin of #1020. On stress effusion 105 (an EffusionLiner, 5
segments) the plate rows are the only ones fixing each chamber's pressure
level, and their McGreehan-Schotsch crossflow Cd = exp(-Rv^n) underflows at a
far iterate: the row of chamber ln__b1 carries d/dP = 7.6e-309. In the
Jacobian hybrj requested at its 48th evaluation that entry became R's pivot.
hybrj's dogleg guards only an exactly zero pivot, so the Gauss-Newton step
overflowed, the dogleg step and the trust radius went NaN, and evaluations
49-56 were all NaN until hybr gave up ("not making good progress").
