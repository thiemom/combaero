    The correlation gives the RIBBED-SIDE heat transfer. Combining it with the

    design choice rather than a property of the correlation -- the channel is
    the internal wall by definition, and the other side of it is a different
    channel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    correlation_set : object
        A ``combaero.RibCorrelationSet``. Defaults to Han (1988) for 90 deg
        orthogonal ribs. Supply your own to match measured data: the set
        records its own source and provenance class, so a tuned coefficient
        cannot pass for a published one.
    e_D, p_e, alpha_deg : float
        Rib height / hydraulic diameter, pitch / height, and angle to the flow.
    W_H : float
        Channel width / height. It lives here rather than on the element
        because a channel is defined by its hydraulic diameter, which does not
        determine an aspect ratio -- a 2:1 duct and a square one can share a
        Dh. The correlation needs the ratio for both the wall-law geometry
        group and the ribbed/smooth area split, so the rib model carries it.
    n_ribbed_walls : int
        How many of the four walls carry ribs. 2 means two OPPOSITE walls,
        which is the configuration Han measured.
    smooth_wall_Nu_multiplier : float
        A user knob on the SMOOTH walls' contribution to the channel average.
        It encodes nothing and defaults to 1.0.

        It exists because the ribbed side already has a better knob -- change
        ``C_G`` on the parameter set, which records what you did -- while the
        smooth walls come from the base Gnielinski correlation and have none.

        Its practical use is the documented gap below. A plain smooth wall
        gives ``h_s/h_r`` around 0.42, where Han's own channel average implies
        0.70, because ribs enhance the adjacent smooth wall by 10-50% as well.
        Setting this to about **1.67** reproduces Han's measured average for
        the two-ribbed-wall square-channel case.

class ImpingementModel:
    """Jet array impingement cooling for ONE spanwise row, evaluated from a
    provenanced parameter set (Florschuetz, Truman and Metzger 1981).

    A real array's rows see progressively more crossflow as spent air from
    upstream rows accumulates -- there is no single "channel Nu" for a whole
    array the way there is for a smooth or ribbed duct. Model the array by
    chaining ``n_rows`` separate elements, each with its own ``ImpingementModel``
    and ``row``, the same way a real duct is built from segments elsewhere in
    this codebase. This element does not do that chaining or the row-to-row
    mass-flow bookkeeping for you: see ``row`` below for what it assumes
    instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    correlation_set : object
        A ``combaero.JetArrayCorrelationSet``. Defaults to
        ``florschuetz_1981_inline()``. Supply ``florschuetz_1981_staggered()``
        for a staggered hole pattern, or your own tuned set.
    d_jet : float
        Jet hole diameter [m]. This row's characteristic length for both
        ``Re_j`` and ``h = Nu * k / d_jet``.
    xn_d, yn_d, z_d : float
        Streamwise hole spacing, spanwise hole spacing, and channel height
        (jet-plate-to-target-plate gap), each normalised by ``d_jet``.
    row : int
        This row's position, 1-indexed counting from upstream. Row 1 sees
        zero crossflow by definition (``Gc/Gj = 0``, matching Florschuetz's
        own ``Nu1``); ``crossflow_to_jet_ratio_at_row`` computes the rest
        from geometry alone, so no other row's state is needed here.
    C_D : float
        Jet-plate discharge coefficient, feeding the ``Gc/Gj`` closed form.
        Defaults to the source's own recommendation absent a measured value
        (``FLORSCHUETZ_1981_DEFAULT_CD = 0.79``) -- combaero has no
        discharge-coefficient correlation of its own for a jet-plate array
        yet, see issue #375.

    What this element assumes about mass flow. The ELEMENT's mass flow is
    this row's jet flow, and ``self.area`` (on the enclosing
    ``ConvectiveSurface``) is THIS ROW's target-plate footprint, which counts
    its holes: ``n = area / (xn_d d_jet * yn_d d_jet)``, so each hole carries
    ``m_dot / n`` and ``Re_j = 4 (m_dot/n) / (pi d_jet mu)`` -- Florschuetz's
    jet mass velocity on the hole area. (Until #460 the flow was taken as
    ``rho v * area``, which made it scale with the target area.) Whether every
    row gets
    the same total flow (a uniform-supply approximation) or a row-dependent
    one (Florschuetz's own Eq. 7, deliberately not implemented -- see
    ``impingement_correlation.h``'s module comment) is up to how the caller
    assembles the chain of elements, not this model.

    What this element does NOT model. The jet plate's own orifice pressure
    loss: model that with a proper ``OrificeElement`` upstream, using a real
    discharge-coefficient correlation -- duplicating it here with a
    hand-rolled formula would risk double-counting it. Friction/pressure
    drop reported here (``f``, ``dP``) is the CROSSFLOW's own plain
    smooth-duct value: Han's book gives no friction correlation for
    impingement the way it does for ribs (there is no ``R``/``f``
    relationship in Eq. 4.9), so this is the best available proxy for the
    spent-air flow along the channel, not a claim that impingement leaves
    friction unchanged.

    Unlike ``ImpingementModel``, there is no array and no crossflow -- this
    is one jet, one target patch. The correlation's Nu is the AVERAGE over the
    disc of radius ``R`` around the stagnation point (Han: "an average
    heat-transfer coefficient correlation"; Eq. 4.1's ``Nu_bar``), so ``R_D``
    sets the patch it describes. A ``ChannelElement`` left without a
    convective area gets exactly that disc, ``pi (R_D d_jet)^2`` (#462).

    Parameters
    ----------
    correlation_set : object
        A ``combaero.SingleJetImpingementSet``. Defaults to
        ``goldstein_1986_single_jet()``.
    bc : object
        A ``combaero.ImpingementThermalBC``. The correlation's ``(R/D)``
        exponent switches on which surface boundary condition it was fitted
        under; this does not change what the element computes for, only
        which of the source's two curves it reads from.
    d_jet : float
        Jet diameter [m].
    L_D : float
        Jet-to-target-plate spacing / ``d_jet``. Defaults to 7.75, the
        source's own optimum spacing -- a defensible default, not a claim
        about any particular rig.
    R_D : float
        Radius of the averaging disc / ``d_jet``: Nu is Goldstein's average
        over the disc of radius ``R`` around the stagnation point. No
        default: the source's closed-form check point uses 5.0, but that is
        a worked example, not a universal choice.

    Mass flow. The ELEMENT's mass flow is the jet's flow, through its one
    hole: ``Re = 4 m_dot / (pi d_jet mu)``, Goldstein's nozzle Reynolds
    number. ``self.area`` is the target patch the reported h applies to; it
    does not set the flow. (Until #460 it did, as ``rho v * area``.)

    Pressure drop is not modelled here for the same reason as
    ``ImpingementModel``: model the nozzle's own loss with a proper
    ``OrificeElement`` upstream, not a formula duplicated inside this
    heat-transfer model. ``f``/``dP`` reported here are the target-side
    channel's own plain smooth-duct values, borrowed for a T_aw computation
    Han's Eq. 4.2/4.3 recovery-factor model would otherwise have to supply

    Parameters
    ----------
    nu_set : object
        A ``combaero.PinFinNuSet`` on the Total surface. Defaults to

    f_set : object

        ``chyu_1990_friction(Inline)`` for inline ones -- the only inline
        friction source in hand, fitted to its digitised Fig. 6 at one
        geometry (H/D 1, S/D = X/D = 2.5). Staggered friction is never
        substituted for inline.
    modifier : object
        An optional ``combaero.PinFinRatioModifier`` applied to ``nu_set``
        (and to ``f_set`` when it carries a friction ratio), e.g.
        ``chyu_1998_inline_over_staggered()`` to transfer a staggered set to
        an inline array. Its ``from_arrangement`` must match ``nu_set``'s and
        its ``to_arrangement`` this array's.
    pin_diameter : float
        Pin diameter D [m].
    S_D, X_D, H_D : float
        Transverse pitch, streamwise pitch and pin height (= channel height),
        each over D.
    N_rows : int
        Pin rows along the flow. Sets the pressure drop and is checked against
        the sets' own row counts (no row correction is applied yet).
    arrangement : object
        ``combaero.PinArrangement``.
    k_pin : float
        Pin thermal conductivity [W/(m K)] for the fin efficiency. 20 is a
        nickel superalloy at turbine metal temperatures; ``math.inf`` treats
        the pins as isothermal.

    Area and velocity conventions. ``ConvectiveSurface.area`` is the BASE
    (planform) area of the endwall this surface couples to; the effective
    coefficient returned is referenced to it,
    ``h_eff = h (A_endwall_exposed + eta_fin A_pin_half) / A_base``, with each
    wall feeding its pins to mid-height. The element's flow area is the
    UNOBSTRUCTED channel cross-section; Vmax follows from it exactly through
    the array geometry.

    The defaults are a working example inside the Metzger sets' box
    (5 mm pins, H/D 1, S/D = X/D = 2.5, 10 rows, Inconel-class pins), not a
    generic "typical" pin fin.

        Two things are asymmetric here and both follow from the source rather
        than from convenience.

        FRICTION NEEDS NO WALL WEIGHTING. The ``f`` in the roughness function's
        definition is already the equivalent four-sided channel friction
        factor, so the correlation returns a channel-level value directly. The
        element does not multiply pipe friction by anything -- correlations own
        their ``f``, which is what #331 established after a round-trip through
        a restated friction factor moved a drop by -24.7%.

        HEAT TRANSFER DOES. The correlation gives the ribbed side; the smooth
        walls come from the base correlation, and the channel average is the
        area-weighted combination.

        A DOCUMENTED GAP. Using the plain smooth correlation for the smooth
        walls gives h_s/h_r around 0.42, where Han's own reported channel
        average implies 0.70 -- because ribs enhance the adjacent smooth wall
        by 10-50% as well, which no correlation here covers. The channel
        average is therefore about 20% below Han's measurement for the
        two-ribbed-wall square case. That is a knowable, quantified
        under-prediction rather than an invented constant, and
        ``smooth_wall_Nu_multiplier`` is how a user closes it: about 1.67

class OrificeElement(NetworkElement):
    """
    Orifice flow element with incompressible or compressible formulation.

    - regime='incompressible': m_dot = Cd * A * sqrt(2 * rho * dP)
    - regime='compressible': Uses isentropic nozzle flow with smooth choked transition

    The discharge coefficient Cd is determined by the 'correlation' parameter:
      - 'fixed': Uses the user-supplied Cd value directly.
      - 'ReaderHarrisGallagher': Sharp thin-plate (ISO 5167-2:2003 / RHG).
      - 'Stolz': ISO 5167:1980.
      - 'IdelchikThick': Deep hole in a wall, Idelchik diagram 4-18a
        (requires plate_thickness). Valid Re 25 to 1e6.
      - 'IdelchikBeveled': Beveled-edge hole, diagram 4-18b
        (requires bevel_depth).
      - 'IdelchikRounded': Rounded-edge hole, diagram 4-18c
        (requires edge_radius).
      - 'McGreehanSchotsch': Long cooling hole (1988). Plenum-fed here, so
        its inlet-crossflow term sees U1/Vi = 0; only EffusionPlateElement's
        duct-fed panels feed it a crossflow.
      - 'Lichtarowicz': LONG orifice, Lichtarowicz, Duggins and Markland
        (1965), l/d 2-10 and Re 10 to 2e4 (requires plate_thickness).
        Refused below l/d = 1.5, where the source reports hysteresis.

    The first two are NORMED metering correlations: Cd is referenced to the
    tapping differential and is a function of beta = d/D. Both are evaluated
    at D-D/2 taps, the ones ISO's permanent-loss relation is derived for: the
    tap choice is a measurement convention and must not move the solved flow
    (#645), so ``tap`` only selects the differential reported as ``dP_tap``.

    Between pipes (a pipe on the side the flow comes from sets beta, and a
    pipe on the side it goes to recovers the pressure) a metering or 'fixed'
    orifice charges ISO 5167-2's PERMANENT loss, not the tapping
    differential: the row's drop is the stagnation difference between the
    two nodes, mapped to the tap pressure through k(beta, C)
    (orifice_tap_pressure_and_jacobian). Discharging into a node with no
    pipe beyond it, the jet's head is lost there and the drop is the tapping
    differential. The discharge-hole family keeps that form in a pipe too,
    until its in-pipe diagrams land. The last five are
    DISCHARGE correlations for a hole in a wall, where zeta is referenced to
    the hole velocity and there is no beta. They are not interchangeable, and
    there is deliberately no 'Auto' arm choosing between them from geometry.

class EffusionPlateElement(OrificeElement):
    """A multi-perforated (effusion) wall panel: N holes discharging in parallel.

    Coolant enters from `from_node` and leaves through the wall into
    `to_node`, so mass leaves the coolant circuit -- which is what makes this
    an element rather than a `ConvectiveSurface` model.

    GEOMETRY IS GIVEN THE WAY A PLATE IS DESIGNED, not as an area: pitch,
    hole diameter, wall thickness and inclination angle. The hole count
    follows from the panel area and the pitch, and is rounded to a whole
    number of holes -- `hole_count_exact` and `pitch_actual` record what the
    rounding did, because the rounded count is what the element flows.

        n_holes  = round(panel_area / (pitch_x * pitch_y))
        L_hole   = wall_thickness / sin(angle)     <- the drilled length
        A_total  = n_holes * pi * d^2 / 4
        porosity = A_total / panel_area

    HOMOGENISATION, AND WHEN IT BREAKS. One element is one panel with one
    coolant pressure and one gas pressure, so it cannot represent coolant
    migration WITHIN itself. van de Noort and Ireland (2022) show this is not
    a small effect: with uniform inlet AND outlet pressure, holes at the end
    of an array can pass ~75% of what a central hole passes, and under a
    spanwise pressure gradient one row took ~10% of the total while others
    took ~20% each.

    The answer is to use more panels, not a cleverer one. Because the solver
    balances mass over every element at a node, a panel hung off each segment
    of a coolant channel reproduces their flow network directly:

        coolant:  P0 --[Channel]-- n1 --[Channel]-- n2 --[Channel]-- ...
                                    |               |
                            [EffusionPanel]  [EffusionPanel]
                                    |               |
        gas:                       g1              g2

    At each node, `m_channel_in = m_channel_out + m_effusion`, which is the
    coolant mass flow falling along the wall -- the effusion CHANNEL case,
    with no channel-specific element needed. Resolution is the caller's
    choice of segment count. Compare `dP_drive` across panels to see whether
    one panel is smearing a gradient that deserves several.

    INGESTION. If the gas pressure exceeds the coolant pressure the panel
    ingests hot gas. That is a real failure mode (van de Noort's CMF > 0.5),
    and a homogenised panel would otherwise average it into a healthy net
    outflow, so `diagnostics()` reports `is_ingesting` rather than staying
    silent about it.

    DISCHARGE COEFFICIENT. Default `IdelchikThick`: diagram 4-18a is a
    thick-walled hole in a large wall between two plena, which is exactly a
    plenum-fed effusion plate, and it is valid down to Re = 25. For a panel
    fed by a channel rather than a plenum the approach flow is a CROSSFLOW,
    which is McGreehan-Schotsch's `U1/Vi` term -- use `'McGreehanSchotsch'`
    there. Note that neither carries a velocity-of-approach `beta` factor:
    a plenum has no approach velocity to correct for. van de Noort applies
    one built on a half-pitch square inlet area, which is worth knowing about
    but is a different convention; at their own pitch it is a 0.3% effect.

    THERMAL, INTERNAL SIDE. `internal_heat_transfer()` gives the coolant-side
    coefficient from Andrews 86-GT-225: the hole APPROACH flow over the
    coolant-side surface plus the THROAT, summed. The approach term dominates
    at effusion Reynolds numbers, which is the paper's own headline and the
    reason a throat-only treatment recovers only a fraction of the measured
    coefficient.

    THE PLATE OWNS ITS WALL (#471). `wall_heat_transfer()` -- reported in
    the diagnostics -- solves the wall with the coolant side above and a gas
    side the DISCHARGE NODE decides: a MomentumChamberNode (flow) supplies
    its own unblown coefficient, gas temperature and velocity; a plenum
    (state, no flow) takes the imposed `gas_heat_flux`. No ThermalWall
    connects to this element.

    AN OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS CORRELATION IS NEVER THE CLOSURE. Andrews
    (88-GT-290) states internal and film cooling are NOT additive -- "the
    film cooling reduces the mean gas temperature adjacent to the wall...
    which in turn reduces the heat flux removed by the internal wall
    cooling" -- and an overall correlation already contains the internal
    convection computed here. The overall effectiveness is an OUTPUT. An
    adiabatic film (Baldauf + Sellers, `gas_film='baldauf_sellers'`) is
    selectable, off by default: scored on Andrews, the data refuse it offered
    alone; the missing physics is the gas-side augmentation
    (`gas_augmentation`, the caller's).

    PLENUM-FED. This 2-port plate leaves McGreehan-Schotsch's U1/Vi at 0 and
    uses Andrews' still-plenum coolant side; `coolant_crossflow_ignored`
    flags a supply node a channel runs through.

            h_gas = h_gas_unblown * gas_augmentation
            eta   = (h_i + h_gas eta_film) / (h_i + h_gas)
            T_wall = T_gas - eta (T_gas - T_coolant)

        The gas side is the caller's; `eta` and the wall temperature are
        the outputs. An overall-effectiveness CORRELATION must never be the
        closure here -- it would already contain the internal convection
        this computes, and the two would double-count.

        THE FILM IS TWO NUMBERS, NOT ONE, and the signature says so. The
        standard film-cooling form is `q = h_f (T_aw - T_w)` with
        `T_aw = T_gas - eta_film (T_gas - T_c)`, so a film owes you both a
        driving temperature (`eta_film`) AND a conductance
        (`gas_augmentation = h_f/h_0`). An adiabatic effectiveness
        correlation such as `film_effectiveness_baldauf_2002` supplies only
        the first: an adiabatic wall passes no heat, so the experiment
        fixes `T_aw` and measures no coefficient. Supplying `eta_film`
        while leaving `gas_augmentation` at 1.0 therefore OVER-PREDICTS,
        and both default to their no-film values so that omitting the pair
        is consistent rather than half-right.

        `gas_augmentation` IS THE CALLER'S, NEVER FITTED HERE. It matches
        `Nu_multiplier` on `ConvectiveSurface`: the library states what the
        correlations give, and matching a specific rig is the user's job.
        See docs/VALIDATION_POLICY.md.

        MIND WHAT `h_gas_unblown` IS MEASURED AGAINST. An augmentation
        ratio is meaningless without its baseline, and mixing baselines is
        a factor-level error, not a refinement. For Andrews 88-GT-290's rig
        the required `gas_augmentation` (plate B, with Baldauf's film) is
        2.7-4.7 against a fully developed Dittus-Boelter and 1.5-2.7
        against the same duct with a thermal-entry correction -- a factor
        of 1.76 from that choice alone (both plates, both baselines:
        validation/cooling/extractions/andrews_effusion_overall_eta.md). Published film-cooling ratios are usually referenced to a
        flat-plate turbulent boundary layer at the same x, which is a third
        baseline again.

        WHAT SCORING IT AGAINST ANDREWS SHOWED. At `gas_augmentation = 1.0`
        and `eta_film = 0.0` the closure scores +3.1% on his effusion plate
        C and +23.7% on plate B -- and plate C's agreement is a
        CANCELLATION, a real film raising `eta` against its augmentation
        lowering it, not evidence that either is absent. The two plates
        need gas-side coefficients differing by 1.7x, and that ratio
        survives any choice of film model (scaling Baldauf's `eta_film`
        from 0 to 1.25x moves it only 1.96 to 1.60). So the missing physics
        is a `gas_augmentation` correlation for full-coverage effusion,
        which needs a HEATED-wall measurement; a better film correlation
        cannot supply it. See
        `validation/cooling/extractions/andrews_effusion_overall_eta.md`.

        Pass `U_gas` to get the jet ratios reported beside the result.
        They are REPORTED AND NEVER APPLIED -- no threshold is offered,
        because the requirement collapses on none of the velocity ratio,
        the blowing ratio or the momentum flux ratio. If `velocity_ratio`
        exceeds about 1 -- Andrews' plate B ejects at 53 m/s into a
        26.8 m/s crossflow -- treat `eta` as an upper bound unless
        `gas_augmentation` already accounts for it.

        Returns `{}` when there is no coolant flow or no gas side. With
        `U_gas` omitted the jet ratios are absent rather than guessed.

    """One spanwise row of an impingement jet plate, with its target wall (#465).

    The element's mass flow IS the row's jet flow: it leaves the supply plenum
    (``from_node``) through ``n_holes`` holes and joins the crossflow channel
    between jet plate and target (``to_node``). So the same element carries
    the orifice flow AND the Florschuetz, Truman and Metzger (1981) heat
    transfer on the target, which is what ``ImpingementModel`` on a
    ``ChannelElement`` cannot do: there the element's flow is the channel's.

    A full array is a chain, one plate per row:

        supply plenum ---+---------------+---------------+
                         |               |               |
                    [Plate 1]       [Plate 2]       [Plate 3]
                         |               |               |
        crossflow:      c1 --[Channel]-- c2 --[Channel]-- c3 --[Channel]-- exit

    CROSSFLOW FROM THE NETWORK. Florschuetz's crossflow-to-jet mass velocity
    ratio is

        Gc/Gj = (m_c / m_j) (pi/4) / ((yn/d)(z/d))

    with ``m_j`` this row's jet flow and ``m_c`` the crossflow APPROACHING the
    row: every inflow to ``to_node`` except this element's own. In the chain
    above that is the channel from the previous crossflow node, which carries
    rows 1..i-1 -- Florschuetz's Eq. 8 evaluated at x - xn/2. The ratio is
    read from the solved flows, not from the uniform-supply closed form, so a
    non-uniform supply, a row of different geometry, or a bleed shows up in
    the heat transfer. ``h`` therefore depends on a NEIGHBOUR's mass flow; the
    element exposes that as ``dh_dsources`` and the solver relays it into the
    Jacobian.

    An INITIAL crossflow (flow entering upstream of row 1, #467) enters
    through an ``ImpingementCrossflowElement(bypass_inlet=True)`` and counts
    in ``m_c`` like any other. The flow distribution is checked against
    Florschuetz, Metzger and Su (1982, NASA CR-3630) Table D.1. The heat
    transfer stays Florschuetz et al. (1981), who had none, at the local
    Gc/Gj -- CR-3630's own usage. A bypass at ANOTHER temperature moves the
    target's reference temperature (Florschuetz and Su 1985, NASA CR-3936,
    Eq. 2.11; see "THE TARGET" below). ``Gc/Gj`` beyond 0.8 is
    flagged by the set's own range check.

    THE TARGET. ``surface.area`` is the target footprint of the holes,
    ``n_holes * xn * yn``. ``T_aw`` is the reference temperature for h:

        T_aw = T_j + eta_r(Gc/Gj, z/d) phi_0 (T_0 - T_j)

    T_j the supply (Florschuetz's own reference, plenum-fed so static and
    total coincide), T_0 the bypass node's temperature, phi_0 the bypass
    share of the crossflow approaching this row (its lead-in flow over m_c),
    eta_r ``cb.impingement_eta_r``: a closure FITTED to CR-3936 Appendix A
    (the source publishes none). Only the bypass's share: the wall's own
    heating of the spent air is already inside Florschuetz's h, whose tests
    had no initial crossflow, so counting it again would double it. With no
    bypass, or one at T_j, T_aw is T_j exactly. ``eta_r_extrapolated`` in
    the diagnostics flags geometry or Gc/Gj outside the inline data; a
    staggered array is outside it too (the summary says so). The heat
    leaves the wall into ``to_node``: the spent air carries it downstream.

    DISCHARGE COEFFICIENT. Default ``'fixed'`` at Florschuetz's own 0.79
    (measured 0.73-0.85 across their plates). The hole Cd does not depend on
    the crossflow: McGreehan-Schotsch's ``U1/Vi`` is the SUPPLY-side
    approach velocity, zero for a plenum, never Gc/Gj. Selectable
    alternatives, never chosen automatically: ``'IdelchikThick'``,
    ``'Lichtarowicz'`` (long hole, l/d 2-10) and ``'McGreehanSchotsch'``.
    ``Cd_in_range`` in the diagnostics says whether the plate is inside the
    chosen correlation's source range.

    NOT MODELLED. The temperature sensitivity of the correlation's
    properties (``dh_dT`` is 0, the same documented gap the channel
    impingement path has), the self-heated crossflow's temperature beyond
    what Florschuetz's plenum-referenced h holds (only a bypass's share
    moves T_aw), and the jet plate's own heat pick-up.

    An orifice element with user-specified effective area (Cd * A product).

    This element calculates orifice flow using the incompressible flow equation:
        m_dot = A_eff * sqrt(2 * rho * dP)

    where A_eff is the effective area (the product Cd * A).

    **Incompressible Formulation**: The solver uses `cb.orifice_mdot_and_jacobian()`,
    which applies the incompressible Bernoulli equation with regularization for numerical
    stability. Density is evaluated at upstream conditions. For compressible flows with
    significant Mach number effects, use a nozzle element instead (future feature).

    **Effective Area Interpretation**: The effective area represents the combined effect
    of discharge coefficient and geometric area. For example:
    - A_eff = 0.01 m^2 could represent Cd=1.0 * A=0.01 m^2
    - Or equivalently: Cd=0.8 * A=0.0125 m^2
    - The product (Cd * A) is what matters for flow calculation

    Unlike LosslessConnectionElement, this element produces pressure drop proportional to flow rate.
    Use this when you need a simple area-based flow restriction without detailed geometry modeling.

    The effective area is user-specified and already accounts for all geometric effects
    (entrance/exit losses, contraction, vena contracta, etc.), so upstream/downstream
    geometry discovery is not performed.

    Discrete pressure-loss edge.  Enforces ``Pt_out = Pt_in * (1 - xi)``
    where ``xi`` is supplied by a user correlation callable.

    The loss follows the FLOW: "in" is the upstream node of the flow as it
    runs, and the correlation sees ``|m_dot|`` and that node's state. A
    reversed element used to apply its loss in the declared direction, which
    for a constant fraction raised total pressure by ``1 / (1 - xi)`` (#550),
    and a head loss returned no loss at all. Through zero flow the forward
    and reverse forms are blended (``FLOW_REVERSAL_M_SCALE``), as the area
    change does.

    Four standard correlations are provided in :mod:`combaero.network.pressure_loss`:

    - :class:`ConstantFractionLoss` -- fixed fractional total-pressure drop.
    - :class:`ConstantHeadLoss` -- Euler loss coefficient (dynamic head).
    - :class:`LinearThetaFractionLoss` -- ``xi = k * theta + xi0``.
    - :class:`LinearThetaHeadLoss` -- ``xi = (k * theta + zeta0) * q / P_in``.

    Theta-aware correlations need a reference node with ``has_theta = True``
    (e.g. :class:`CombustorNode`).  Discovery precedence:

    1. ``theta_source=<node_id>`` constructor kwarg (explicit override).
    2. ``to_node`` endpoint if it has ``has_theta = True``.
    3. ``from_node`` endpoint if it has ``has_theta = True``.
    4. Cold-flow fallback: ``theta = 0``.  If the correlation is linear-theta
       a :class:`UserWarning` is emitted at resolution time.

    Placing the element between two ``has_theta = True`` nodes without an
    explicit ``theta_source`` raises ``ValueError`` during
    :meth:`FlowNetwork.validate`.

    relation, not here (see the note in ``residuals``).

    Pressure drop
        ``regime="incompressible"`` uses Darcy-Weisbach with a friction factor
        selected by ``friction_model`` from Haaland, Colebrook, Serghides or
        Petukhov; ``regime="compressible"`` uses Fanno flow. Both are computed
        in C++ -- ``friction.h`` owns the correlations and
        ``solver_interface.h`` the (f, J) entry points. Nothing about the
        friction factor is restated in this file.

    Convective surfaces
        A ``ConvectiveSurface`` adds heat transfer. Ribbed and pin-fin surfaces
        also OWN the drop: their correlations return the channel's friction
        factor (ribs: the four-sided Darcy value; pins: Metzger's per-row
        ``dP / (2 rho Vmax^2 N)``), and the element uses it directly rather
        than as a multiplier on pipe friction -- see ``_ribbed_residuals`` and
        ``_pin_fin_residuals``. Impingement surfaces leave the drop to the
        smooth path (model the jet plate with an ``OrificeElement``).
        Provenance lives with each correlation set: ``rib_correlation.h``,
        ``pin_fin_correlation.h``, ``impingement_correlation.h``.

    Known gaps
        The array correlations expose no dP sensitivity to static pressure or
        composition, so those Jacobian columns are absent rather than
        approximated; ``test_channel_element_jacobian_fd.py`` pins this as a
        strict xfail carrying the magnitude.

        No multiplier on pipe friction. The `f` the roughness function is
        defined against is already the equivalent four-sided channel value, so
        the correlation returns what the channel needs and the element uses it
        directly. Routing it through a locally restated smooth friction factor
        is what #331 removed, after the round-trip moved a drop by -24.7%.

        The Jacobian is simpler than it looks. `R` carries no `e+` term in this
        correlation family, so **f does not depend on Reynolds number** and
        therefore not on mass flow: `df/d(mdot) = 0`. The drop is
        `f (L/D) rho v |v| / 2` with `v = mdot / (rho A)`, so

            dP          = f (L/D) mdot |mdot| / (2 rho A^2)
            d(dP)/dmdot = f (L/D) |mdot| / (rho A^2)

        which is even in `mdot` and so does not flip sign at zero -- the drop
        itself carries the sign. That is the odd-quantity case: magnitude from
        the correlation, direction from the flow.

        `dP` also depends on upstream temperature and static pressure through
        `rho(T, P)` -- `d(dP)/d(rho) = -dP/rho`, chained through
        `density_and_jacobians`' analytic `d(rho)/dT`, `d(rho)/dP` and
        `_safe_rho`'s own floor derivative. This was a real, measured gap
        (issue #378): the analytic `A.T` column was exactly 0.0 against a
        finite-difference value of roughly -486 for a representative case,
        because `_safe_rho(state_in.density())` computed `rho` without ever
        differentiating it. Composition (`Y`) sensitivity through molecular
        weight remains an accepted gap -- no correlation-level Jacobian for
        it exists yet, and no other channel-friction path in this file

    A ``ChannelElement`` (friction, stagnation-pressure coupling) plus the
    momentum of side streams joining or leaving at its end nodes. Over one
    station, ``m_a`` arriving and ``m_b`` leaving along the channel of area
    A, with the side stream's AXIAL velocity ``kappa * u_a``, momentum gives
    the static-pressure drop

        dP = (m_b|m_b| - m_a|m_a| + kappa m_a (m_a - m_b)) / (rho A^2)

    * ``kappa = 0``: normal injection (impingement jets). Florschuetz's
      P + G^2/rho = const.
    * ``kappa = 0.75`` (``cb.STATION_KAPPA_BLEED_BASSETT``): bleed through the
      wall. Bassett, Winterbone & Pearson's (2001) separating straight-run
      coefficient K2/K5 (Eq. 15), theta- and psi-independent, reproduced for
      every split.

    CENTRED: a segment carries half of the station at each end, each at its
    node's own density (C++ ``station_half_drop``), so every node holds the
    static pressure at the middle of its station. Ends are explicit, wired by
    whoever builds the chain:

    * ``from_kappa`` with ``prev_seg``: a station at ``from_node``; the flow
      arriving there is ``prev_seg``'s (0 if None: a closed end).
    * ``to_kappa`` with ``next_seg``: a station at ``to_node``; the flow
      leaving it is ``next_seg``'s.
    * ``entry_K``: ``from_node`` is a reservoir; the segment carries the
      entry acceleration ``(1 + K_in) m^2/(2 rho A^2)`` at the duct (to-node)
      density instead of a from-station. Reversed, the duct discharges into
      the reservoir at static continuity, the same as an exit: no term.
    * an exit into a plenum (no to-station) loses the dynamic head: static
      continuity, as any Pt-coupled channel into a plenum.

    Station nodes must be PlenumNodes (Pt = P): the node pressure is the
    channel's static pressure, which is what a side stream sees.

    FRICTION follows ``ChannelElement``: Darcy-Weisbach on the
    equivalent-area diameter (the C++ channel's circular convention, #463).

    COMPRESSIBLE, the friction is the Fanno flow and the station drop shifts
    its discharge target: Pt_in drives against Pt_out + dP_momentum, the
    incompressible balance as Ma -> 0 (#585).

    """The crossflow channel between a jet plate and its target, one row pitch (#465).

    A ``CrossflowSegmentElement`` with normal-injection stations
    (``kappa = 0``): the jets that merge at each row arrive with NO
    streamwise momentum, so the crossflow must accelerate them -- the
    momentum equation behind Florschuetz, Truman and Metzger's (1981) flow
    distribution (Eqs. 7-8), P + G_c^2/rho = const. Without it every row sees
    the same pressure difference and the supply stays uniform; with it the
    downstream rows draw more. Area ``height * span``.

    Chain it with plenum crossflow nodes, one per row:

        c1 --[Crossflow]-- c2 --[Crossflow]-- c3 --[Crossflow]-- exit
         |                  |                  |
      [Plate 1]          [Plate 2]          [Plate 3]

    The neighbours are found from the chain itself: the crossflow segment
    arriving at ``from_node`` (none at row 1: a closed end) and the one
    leaving ``to_node`` (none into the exit, where the dynamic head is lost).
    Centred, each node holds its row's mid-merge static pressure: putting the
    whole merge downstream instead over-fed the downstream rows (Gc/Gj at row
    10 of Florschuetz's strongest-crossflow geometry 13% below Eq. 8, against
    a few percent centred).

    BYPASS INLET (#467). ``bypass_inlet=True`` makes this the lead-in from
    the gap's upstream end to row 1, carrying an initial crossflow. Its
    ``from_node`` has no jets, and what arrives there decides the physics:

    * another impingement gap's last segment (arrays in series): the stream
      continues with its momentum, a station with nothing injected. The two
      gaps must have the same cross-section;
    * anything else: the segment accelerates the bypass from ``from_node``'s
      TOTAL pressure, ``entry_K`` the entry loss. A feed channel keeps its Pt
      into a plenum or a momentum chamber alike, so its dynamic head arrives
      with it: 0 for a bypass arriving along a duct, 0.5 for an abrupt
      sharp-edged entry from a large plenum.

    Florschuetz, Metzger and Su (1982, NASA CR-3630) delivered the initial
    crossflow fully developed, with its momentum, after 16 to 95 hydraulic
    diameters: the first case, or a chamber fed by a long enough duct.

    The closures are Idelchik's (1966; diagrams 4-1, 3-9, 5-2), carried to Mach
    by their control volume, in C++ (``area_change.h``, #731): an expansion is
    the compressible Borda-Carnot step times the table's ratio to it (the low-Re
    factor of 4-1, the cone's phi of 5-2); a contraction is a vena contracta
    re-expanding by the same step, which chokes. ``regime="incompressible"``
    runs their M -> 0 limit.

    The residual is in mass-flow form, m - m_calc(Pt_from, Pt_to, ...), as the
    compressible channel and orifice are (#481): the flow the drive supports
    rises monotonically with it and saturates at the sonic flow, so it exists for
    every state. Each direction is fed from its own upstream node, and the two
    are blended C1 through zero drive (``area_change_element_flow``).

class MultiPortChamberBase(NetworkElement):
    """
    Momentum-CV junction element (N >= 2 ports).

    ABSTRACT SINCE 0.6.0. This class owns the topology and port machinery --
    port ordering, the inlet/outlet sign map, area and angle resolution, the
    connecting-element wiring checks -- and no longer carries a residual of
    its own. Its impulse-function model was deprecated in 0.5.0 and removed
    here; ``MultiPortChamberElement`` supersedes it (issue #271).

    Subclasses own one scalar unknown ``{id}.P_jct`` and emit N per-port
    relations plus a global mass residual ``sum_i mdot_port_i = 0``, with a
    per-port orientation derived from the topology (positive = flow out of
    the junction). The per-port relation, and with it the port losses, is
    the subclass's closure -- Mynard's for ``MultiPortChamberElement``, fixed
    K for ``ConstantKTeeElement``. Do not add a
    :class:`BorderCarnotLossElement` on a port as well: that double-counts
    the turning loss (#272).

    Topology contract (see PDF Section 2 + addendum task #10):

    - Each port must be a :class:`MomentumChamberNode` (carries P, Pt at the
      port face). The MCN is marked ``_is_junction_port = True`` during
      :meth:`resolve_topology` so the solver skips its mass-balance row -- the
      junction's R_mass takes over conservation at the port (otherwise the
      MCN's mass row degenerates to 0 = 0 once the junction declares the
      same flow with opposite sign).
    - Exactly one element (channel, loss element, etc.) must connect to each
      port-MCN on the outside. Its m_dot is the port's mass-flow source; the
      junction reads it via the graph at residual-eval time, and reports it
      back through ``flow_at_node`` so the state propagation gives every
      port-MCN its real face flow (collector ports would otherwise see zero
      and their Pt = P + 0.5*rho*v^2 closure would degenerate to Pt = P).
    - Sign convention per port is fixed by the inlet/outlet declaration in
      the constructor. ``inlet_nodes`` carry sign ``-1`` (canonical flow INTO
      junction); ``outlet_nodes`` carry sign ``+1`` (canonical flow OUT). The
      connecting outer element's ``from_node``/``to_node`` is then checked
      against the declared direction at :meth:`resolve_topology` and a clear
      error is raised on mismatch. Runtime flow may still reverse (mdot < 0
      at any port); only the canonical direction is fixed for graph topology.

    Port areas are inherited from the connecting :class:`ChannelElement`'s
    diameter unless explicitly given.

    See ``docs/junction/momentum cv implementation guide.pdf`` Sections 2-3
    and ``docs/junction/junction_model_v3_addendum.md`` Finding 6 for the
    motivation (the K-closure's structural K_run ~ 0.30 ceiling and its
    inability to represent ejector / merge-split direction natively).

    Border-Carnot turning-loss element: a two-port in-line loss. It was the
    lateral-port companion of the momentum-CV junction's impulse model,
    removed in 0.6.0 (#322).

    DEPRECATED in 0.7.0, for removal in 0.8.0. Its residual is exactly a
    constant head loss, so the replacement reproduces it to round-off
    (measured 1e-11 in Pt drop and mass flow)::

        PressureLossElement(id, from_node, to_node,
            correlation=ConstantHeadLoss(
                zeta=4 * (1 - cos(0.75 * delta)) ** 2, area=area),
            area=area)

    with ``delta`` the geometric turn in radians. The only thing this class
    adds is that zeta formula, which was derived for a junction's lateral
    branch -- physics both junction closures now carry -- and was never
    compared against bend data. Choose a bend's K from a handbook instead.

    NOT FOR JUNCTION PORTS. ``MultiPortChamberElement`` and
    ``ConstantKTeeElement`` carry each port's turning loss in their own
    closure, and adding this element double-counts it: on Bassett's 90 deg,
    psi = 1 dividing tee, K6 at q = 0.5 is 0.867 from the closure alone
    (Bassett 0.867) and 1.249 with this element (+16% at q = 0.3, +78% at
    0.7; #272).

    Residual (PDF Section 3.1):

        Pt_in - Pt_out - L(delta_geom) * 0.5 * rho_in * u_in^2 = 0
        L = 4 * (1 - cos((3/4) * delta_geom))^2

    The (3/4) factor is Hager's effective-angle correction for sharp-edged
    lateral branches. The form is *intended* to reproduce Hager xi_l and
    Bassett K_inc at M -> 0 on a sharp-edged 90-deg lateral. That was never
    demonstrated: its only check, paired with the removed junction model,
    missed Bassett K6 by 11-29%, and the tests went with that model (#322).
    Do not rely on it being anchored to Hager or Bassett. delta_geom = 0
    gives L = 0.

    The element is sign-free in m_dot (mdot^2 in the dynamic head). The
    initial form has no direction asymmetry parameter; an
    ``alpha_contract`` calibration multiplier can be added later if validation
    data forces it (PDF Section 3.3, deferred).

    Free-vortex swirl redistribution between an inlet radius r_in and an
    outlet radius r_out (#661).

    No work is done on the gas: total pressure and total temperature are
    conserved, and the angular momentum r * V_theta is carried from r_in to
    r_out, so V_theta_out = V_theta_in * r_in / r_out. What changes is the
    static pressure: swirl kinetic energy turns into static pressure going
    outward and back again going inward. That static state is reported in the
    diagnostics; it is not a network unknown.

    The inlet swirl V_theta_in [m/s] is the user's; it defaults to solid-body
    rotation at the shaft speed ``shaft_speed_rpm`` (``omega_rpm`` before
    #773, deprecated, removed in 0.8.0): V_theta_in = 2 pi N / 60 * r_in.

    Until #661 this element added the static radial-equilibrium rise of a
    Vatistas n-vortex to the TOTAL pressure at constant Tt: neither a free
    vortex (no Pt change) nor rotor work (Tt rises with Pt), and it destroyed
    entropy for every omega > 0. Its core radius ``r_c`` and shape ``n`` are
    accepted, ignored, and deprecated (removed in 0.8.0); the Vatistas
    functions themselves (``cb.vatistas_*``) are unchanged.
