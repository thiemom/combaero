        ref_p / ref_mdot is ~1e5, so a row filed under the wrong kind is
        weighted ~1e5 too heavily or too lightly and Newton stalls. This has
        happened repeatedly:
          * MPCE impulse rows filed as "mdot" (2026-07): 187 s stalls.
          * the compressible ChannelElement switched to a mass-flow residual
            (m - m_calc) while still filed as "p" (#481): 697 evaluations
            and a failed solve where 15 sufficed.

        Who declares what (in residual-row order):
          * nodes: their own rows "p", then the mass-conservation row "mdot"
            (skipped for junction ports);
          * junctions (MultiPortChamberBase): row_scale_kinds(), one per row;
          * every other element: ``residual_scale_kind``, a class attribute,
            or a property when the units follow the configuration
            (ChannelElement: "mdot" when compressible, "p" otherwise).
        There is NO default. ``declared_row_kinds`` (components.py) raises at
        network validation unless the kind is declared on the class that
        defines ``residuals`` or a subclass of it, so a subclass that rewrites
        its residual must re-declare its units. Until then a silent "mdot"
        default filed PressureLoss, AreaChange, BorderCarnotLoss (removed in 0.8.0) and Vortex
        rows (all Pa) 1e5-1e9 too heavily (#614).
        Changing an element's residual form means changing its declared kind
        in the same commit. A strict solve (the test suite) then checks every
        declaration against the Jacobian at the converged solution
        (``check_row_kinds``) and raises ``RowKindMismatchError`` on a
        misfiled row: with #616 reverted, 51 suite tests fail naming the
        element, where the suite had passed with the bug in place.

        Testing Jacobians against finite differences has the same trap: a row
        mixes kg/s and Pa columns, so compare J_ij |x_j| (scaled variables),
        never raw entries normalised by the row's largest -- that hid a 100%

        Each element is dPt = K m|m| with K its incompressible
        ``_seed_resistance`` at the reference density; pressure boundaries are
        fixed, mass-flow boundaries inject (a sink draws) their m_dot, every
        other node conserves mass. A monotone network, so it has one solution;
        damped Picard on the conductances G = 1 / (K |m|) finds it. The
        propagated start sets a node's pressure from its neighbours one element
        at a time, and in a large network of resistances decades apart it
        leaves a duct carrying MPa at the guessed flow -- where 48 of 160
        stress random draws stalled even incompressible and adiabatic.

        None when an element offers no resistance, a node is of a type the
        mass balance here does not cover, or there is no pressure boundary.

        evals/30 s; the seed even converges cases where the
        inlet-referenced seed fails -- 2026-07-05 outlet-ref seed
        experiment, tmp/outlet_ref_seed_experiment.py). When a
        ``timeout`` is given and the network holds a
        ``MultiPortChamberBase``, the primary attempt gets 40% of the
        budget, the proxy at most 25%, and the seeded retry the remainder
        (at least 30%). Compressible tee networks are best given 90-120 s
        total. Any other network keeps the whole budget for its cold
        attempt and retries only in the time left, the proxy taking at most
        half of it. Until #585 the retry was limited to junction networks; a
        duct-fed effusion liner, whose cold compressible solve stalls, is
        seeded to its root in one pass from the incompressible one.

        The mirror case: a network INCOMPRESSIBLE throughout (every
        two-regime element incompressible) whose cold solve fails is retried
        from a compressible warm start -- the same network solved with those
        elements compressible, whose root it shares at low Mach (#588). Its
        mass-flow residual forms converge from cold starts where the
        pressure-drop forms stall (a jet pump behind an incompressible pipe:
        zero entrainment from every cold seed, the physical root in a few
        steps from the compressible one). Same budget rules; the strategy is
        reported as ``compressible_warmstart``.

        Pass ``init_strategy='outletref_warmstart'`` to run the proxy
        seed directly as the primary initialization (no cold attempt
        first) -- useful on networks known to stall the cold path.
        Certified audit (2026-07): 16/16 same-root on branch
        topologies, 11/16 on merge -- prefer 'default' /
        'analytical_pt_prop' for merge networks.

        A cold solve of a network with ``ThermalWall`` s that still fails
        is retried once more from the same network solved WITHOUT its walls
        (``thermal_coupling_enabled = False``): the walls move a lot of heat
        into small flows, and a cold Newton step that reverses one of them
        leaves a node heated with almost nothing to carry the heat. The
        wall-less flows are a start on the right side of that (#471:
        impingement array under a hot duct, 6/9 cold vs 9/9 seeded).

        A cold solve of a network with channels carrying their wall heat in
        the momentum (Fanno-Rayleigh, #551) runs in two stages: those channels
        adiabatic first (this whole chain, 60% of the budget), then the exact
        problem from that root; the plain cold chain runs only if that fails.
        Cold, the guess's node temperatures put extreme heating or cooling into
        their first iterates (an impingement crossflow chain: 23 s cold, 4.7 s
        staged).

        A numerical exception while evaluating an attempt's STARTING point
        (a property or closure refusing a physical-but-extreme state) does not
        abort the solve: that attempt ends with outcome ERROR and the retries
        above try their other starts. Exceptions at trial points the root
        finder then rejects were already caught. Every caught exception is
        returned in ``__caught_exceptions__`` (phase, the node or element
        being evaluated, type, message, innermost frames; at most 50, all
        counted in ``__caught_exception_count__``). Set
        ``raise_internal_errors = True`` on the solver, or the environment
        variable ``COMBAERO_SOLVER_STRICT=1``, to make the starting point raise
        as it used to (the test suite runs strict). Code bugs (TypeError,
        AttributeError, KeyError, IndexError) always raise. A strict solve
        also checks each converged solution's residual rows against their
        declared units and raises ``RowKindMismatchError`` on a misfiled one
        (``check_row_kinds``; RESIDUAL-ROW-SCALING).
