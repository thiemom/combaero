"""EjectorElement: 3-port supersonic ejector on the momentum-CV junction
topology (``MultiPortChamberBase``).

Ports: ``primary_node`` (motive, high-pressure inlet), ``secondary_node``
(suction/entrained inlet), ``outlet_node``. Reuses the validated closed-form
physics in ``combaero.network._ejector_huang1999`` (Huang 1999's entrainment
ratio, Eqs. 1-8; Kracik & Dvorak 2016's mixing closure for the critical back
pressure, their Eqs. 7-13) -- see that module's docstring and
``validation/ejector/README.md`` for the full derivation, paper references,
and the accuracy comparison against three alternative closures that were
also evaluated.

Operating regimes. This element resolves all three physical regimes in one
Newton-solvable residual system (design + provenance in
``validation/ejector/OPERATING_REGIMES_DESIGN.md``):

  * CRITICAL (double-choked): primary choked, entrained flow critical, so
    ``omega`` is back-pressure-independent. The outlet floats freely below
    the ejector's critical back pressure ``P_c*``.
  * SUBCRITICAL droop: primary still choked but the outlet is pushed above
    ``P_c*``; the outlet pressure sets the operating point.
  * UNCHOKED jet pump: the forced primary mass flow is below the choke
    threshold ``mdot_choked(P_back)``, so the primary Pt floats to just above
    the back pressure (forward flow, ``dp >= 0``) and the device acts as a
    subsonic constant-area jet pump (Keenan-Neumann-Lustwerk mixing via
    ``ejector_jetpump_discharge``).

The regime is selected smoothly (no branching discontinuity) by two
smootherstep weights: ``s_choke = smootherstep(mp / mdot_choked(Pt_p))``
(0 = unchoked jet pump, 1 = choked) and ``s_sub`` (0 = outlet below ``P_c*``,
critical; 1 = outlet above it, subcritical). See the residual design below.

Working fluid: combaero's real-fluid EOS covers combustion/air-relevant
species only (N2, O2, Ar, CO2, H2O, light hydrocarbons, CO, H2, NH3) -- no
halocarbon refrigerants. gamma and R are evaluated LIVE from that EOS at
each residual call, at the entrained-flow choking plane (same convention
validated in the reference model, there baked from CoolProp for R141b; here
computed on the fly via ``cb.cp_mass``/``cb.cv_mass``), using the secondary
stream's own composition -- Huang's model assumes a single working fluid, so
this is the representative gamma/R for the whole closed form.

Residual design. Ports are ``[primary, secondary, outlet]``, so
``_port_signs = [-1, -1, +1]`` and the base class's ``unknowns()``/
``n_equations()`` (one owned unknown ``{id}.P_jct``, N+1 = 4 rows) are
inherited unchanged -- but the owned unknown is REPURPOSED as the physical
mixing-plane static pressure ``P_py`` (the pressure common to the primary jet
and the entrained stream at the mixing-chamber entrance), and the row content
is ejector physics instead of impulse-CV physics. With ``s = s_choke``:

    R0 = mp - cd_nozzle(Pt_p, P_py, A_t, A_e)      (primary C-D nozzle)
    R1 = ms - [s*omega_ch*mp + (1-s)*ms_sec]       (blended entrainment)
    R2 = mdot_out - mp - ms                        (mass conservation)
    R3 = [w_pin*Pt_outlet + (1-w_pin)*P_py] - recovery*discharge

``omega_ch`` is the choked entrainment: omega_crit up to P_c*, then the
Tier-1 subcritical droop, linear in the outlet Pt down to 0 at the dead-head
P_b0 (#619; the sec 8.1 closure, which the element did not use before).

``P_py`` is a genuine Newton unknown (not derived): it is the quantity the two
nozzle relations R0/R1 share, so making it free keeps BOTH live and lets the
downstream back pressure select the operating regime. ``R0``'s C-D nozzle
smooth-mins the subsonic-flux and sonic-cap branches, so it is choked or
unchoked automatically as ``P_py`` moves. It is strictly monotone in ``P_py`` over the
whole line (#619): the exit Mach is held at 1 below the critical ratio (the
supersonic-exit flux used to dip under the cap at deep expansion), and above
the supply the nozzle passes REVERSE flow, so zero flow pins ``P_py`` to the
supply instead of leaving it free (zero flow at any ``P_py`` above both
supplies used to close every row: a spurious root at ~1e13 Pa). ``discharge = recovery * (s*P_c* +
(1-s)*P03_jetpump)`` blends the critical and jet-pump mixing closures; each is
evaluated ONLY where its weight is nonzero (the critical closures return NaN
for an unchoked primary, and ``0 * NaN = NaN`` would otherwise poison the
Jacobian -- safe because smootherstep is flat at ``s in {0, 1}``).

``R3`` closes the system differently per regime via
``w_pin = 1 - s*(1 - s_b0)`` (the weight on the outlet-pin form; ``s_b0`` is
the smootherstep of ``Pt_outlet / (recovery*P_b0)`` over [0.98, 1.02]):

  * jet pump (s=0): ``w_pin = 1`` -> ``Pt_outlet = recovery*discharge``. The
    outlet is what the ejector sets; the downstream boundary then forces
    ``P_py`` through this pin, and R0/R1 set the primary Pt and entrainment.
  * choked, outlet below the dead-head ``P_b0`` (critical AND subcritical,
    s=1, s_b0=0): ``w_pin = 0`` -> ``P_py = recovery*P_c*`` (a diagnostic) and
    the outlet floats FREE, set by the downstream network, the entrainment
    following it along the droop above ``P_c*``.
  * choked, outlet above ``P_b0`` (s=1, s_b0=1): ``w_pin = 1`` ->
    ``Pt_outlet = recovery*P_b0``. This pin excludes the spurious double-choked
    root (primary Pt below the back pressure), which can only occur above
    ``P_b0`` since ``P_b0 < Pt_primary``. Until #619 it switched in at ``P_c*``
    instead, which also pinned every subcritical outlet below its boundary:
    a choked ejector between ``P_c*`` and ``P_b0`` had no root.

A collapsed droop window (``P_b0`` within 0.1-1% of ``P_c*``, the unchoked
``M_py < 1`` corner) fades back to the plateau-and-pin-at-``P_c*`` form
continuously, since ``P_b0`` depends on Newton unknowns. Beyond ``P_b0`` (the
ejector cannot hold the back pressure: backflow) is outside the model.

``verify_solution_consistent`` now returns True unconditionally: every regime
is modeled, so there is no longer a subcritical design point to demote.

Assembly: the whole 4-row residual system AND its 9-column analytic
Jacobian are built in C++ -- a single ``_solver_tools.
ejector_element_residuals_and_jacobian`` call (``include/ejector.h`` /
``src/ejector.cpp``) that chains the scalar closures through a forward-mode
``DualN<9>`` across the regime blend, matching the whole-element (f, J)
practice of the base ``MultiPortChamberBase`` and ``TeeJunctionElement``.
``residuals()`` here is only the relabeling shim: physical-flow signs and
mapping the nine Jacobian seeds to solver column names.
(``combaero.network._ejector_huang1999`` remains the Python validation
reference the C++ is kept 1:1 with.) The C++ Jacobian is exact w.r.t. the
nine Newton unknowns holding ``gamma`` and ``r_gas`` FROZEN. Here
``gamma = choke_plane_gamma(secondary.Tt, ...)`` is a weak function of a
Newton unknown and ``r_gas`` depends only on composition (not a solved
unknown), so the element Jacobian is exact in the explicit (Pt, Tt)
dependence and drops only the tiny implicit ``d gamma / d Tt`` term -- a
standard frozen-property Jacobian. ``gamma`` is recomputed fresh every
residual call, so the converged root is still exact; only the Newton step
uses a slightly approximate slope. This matches the reference data's own
convention (``generate_reference.py`` treats gamma as a separate Jacobian
input, so its d/dt_e central-difference targets also hold gamma fixed).
``choke_plane_gamma`` therefore stays in Python.
