"""Second-law check per element and a control-volume ledger (#545).

Every converged solve is checked twice after the fact:

* **Per element: no flow work manufactured.** Over each element's control
  volume the entropy generation must not be negative::

      sigma = sum_out m s - sum_in m s - integral dQ / T  >=  0

  with ``s = cb.s_mass(Tt, X, Pt)`` (stagnation state; it includes the ideal
  mixing term) and the heat taken at the fluid's static temperature, which
  makes ``sigma`` the INTERNAL entropy generation -- a necessary condition
  that needs no wall temperature. Both sums and the heat integral are C++
  (``cb.entropy_generation``, ``cb.heat_entropy_flux``). For an adiabatic
  two-port of fixed composition sigma is exactly ``-m R ln(Pt_out / Pt_in)``,
  compressible flow included: "total pressure does not rise". Heating at Mach
  M costs total pressure and cooling may raise it (Rayleigh); the heat term
  allows exactly that, through the static temperature.

  Inside an element only its end Mach numbers are known (its own ``mach_in``
  / ``mach_out`` where it reports them), so the heat is taken along a linear
  Mach path and bracketed by constant-Mach paths at either end:
  ``sigma_norm_low <= sigma_norm <= sigma_norm_high``. ``sigma_norm = sigma /
  (R sum_in m)`` is dimensionless; for a two-port it is ``-ln(Pt_out /
  Pt_in)``. A verdict is ``"pass"``, ``"fail"`` (``sigma_norm_high <
  -SIGMA_TOL``: even the most favourable path destroys entropy) or
  ``"not_checked"`` with the reason -- never a silent pass. A stream on the
  incompressible closure widens the band by that closure's resolution,
  order M^4 (``sigma_norm_resolution``; see ``_sigma``).

* **The network: mass and energy close over its control volume.** The
  streams crossing at the flow boundaries (``NetworkNode.is_flow_boundary``),
  the heat given to the network, and the heat leaving it (``Q_wall_out``, a
  wall's heat landing on a boundary) or withheld (``Q_withheld``, heat a
  stagnant node cannot take). Enthalpy is absolute (formation included), so a
  combustor closes the balance as it is.

Both demote a converged solve that fails them to INCONSISTENT: the ledger
since #552, an element's verdict since #598. A ThermalWall's own check
(``wall_verdicts``) stays a report.

Control volumes
---------------
* A two-port element. The stream enters at its upstream node's state and
  leaves at the downstream node's total pressure (a merge chamber's main
  inlet: at the chamber's main face, which is what it delivers), with the upstream
  composition and the enthalpy its walls added (the solver deposits wall
  heat on the downstream node, so the node's own temperature is a mix).
* A multi-port junction. Each port's stream at its port node's state.
* A chain of crossflow segments (a liner's backside duct). A segment's
  momentum spans half of each station, so one segment is not a control
  volume; the chain is. It is built from the segments' ``prev_seg`` /
  ``next_seg`` links; its stations are the nodes they declare
  (``from_kappa`` / ``to_kappa``), less any boundary. Streams crossing it:
  the chain's two ends, and every other element at a station (the holes), at
  the station's ``Pt`` (which a station's Pt = P closure makes its static
  pressure). Heat on a station node is taken as raising
  the node's mixed stream to the node's temperature. A hole whose jet brings
  axial momentum into the chain (``injection_angle_deg`` below 90, #813) is a
  member instead: its stream enters at its supply's total pressure. The
  chain's pressure recovery is the jet's, so closing the hole at the
  station's Pt would charge the chain with momentum it was given.

Not checked: elements without a solved flow, the legacy
``TeeJunctionElement``, and a stagnant control volume (no flow through it).
