// Parametrised rib-roughness correlations.
//
// Rib correlations in the literature share one algebraic shape: a constant
// times power-law terms in the geometry, with the heat-transfer function
// carrying an extra term in the roughness Reynolds number.
//
//   R = C_R * (e/D / nD)^a * (p/e / nP)^b * (W/H / nW)^c * (alpha/90)^d
//   G = C_G * (same geometry terms) * (e+)^n
//
// Expressing them as data rather than code means a new correlation is a
// parameter set, and a user can supply their own -- which is the expected path
// for real hardware, since no published correlation is precise enough for a
// specific rig.
//
// THE NORMALISER IS PART OF THE DATA, NOT A CONVENTION. (p/e/10)^b and
// (p/e)^b are the same function with different constants: Han's
// R = 3.2 (p/e/10)^0.35 is identically 1.4294 (p/e)^0.35. Applying one
// source's constant under another's convention is wrong by a constant factor
// -- 10^0.35 = 2.24x here -- which never looks like a trend and so survives
// review. Every term therefore carries its own reference value.
//
// R CARRIES NO e+ TERM by construction, so the friction factor this family
// produces is independent of Reynolds number. That is true of both
// correlations in scope (Han 1988, Rallabandi et al. 2009) and it makes
// df/d(mdot) identically zero. A correlation whose R varies with e+ cannot be
// expressed here and would need its own implicit solve.
