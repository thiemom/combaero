//               factor of 4-1, or phi of 5-2).
//   contraction a vena contracta of area Cc F_small re-expanding to F_small by
//               the same compressible Borda-Carnot step, with
//               Cc = 1 / (1 + sqrt(zeta_c)), zeta_c the high-Re zeta (3-9 or

//               3-10's low-Re ratio for a sharp one. It chokes at the vena
